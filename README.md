#### Description: The Blog Management Web Application is a feature-rich platform designed to simplify the process of creating, managing, and sharing blog content. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both bloggers and administrators. Whether you're a writer looking to share your thoughts with the world or an administrator overseeing a community of bloggers, this application has you covered.

This project is a web application created using Python and the Flask framework. It allows users to create and manage a blog. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

Homepage (Index Page): When you visit the website, you'll see a list of blog posts sorted by date. It's like a feed of articles.

Profile Page: If you have an account and log in, you can access your profile page. Here, you can edit your personal information like name, username, and email. You can also change your password.

Dashboard: If you have special privileges (like an admin or owner), you can access the dashboard. It shows a list of all users and allows you to search for specific users.

Search: There are two search features:

Search User: If you have the right privileges, you can search for users by their name, username, email, or privilege.
Search Post: You can search for blog posts by their title or content.
Add User: If you have the right privileges, you can add new users. You enter their information like name, email, and password, and they become users of the website.

Login and Logout: Users can log in and out of their accounts. When logged in, they have access to more features.

Add Post: If you have special privileges, you can add new blog posts. You provide a title and content for the post, and it's added to the website.

View Post: You can click on a blog post to view it in detail. You can see who wrote it and when it was published.

Edit and Delete Users: If you have the right privileges, you can edit or delete user accounts.

Edit and Delete Posts: If you have special privileges or you are the author of a post, you can edit or delete blog posts.

Error Pages: If something goes wrong or a page doesn't exist, the website shows error pages (like a "404 Not Found" page).
